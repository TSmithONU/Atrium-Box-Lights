# Atrium Box Lights

The Box Lights were a large
scale install project intending
to replace the failing
fluorescent RGB system with a
newer and more efficient LED
RGB system. The first step of
the project was to remove the
old system. This required
careful disassembly of the
boxes and removal of the
panels in a specific fashion in
order to replace them in the
same order once the project
was finished. The new LEDs
were installed into the boxes
with DMX decoders, which
were used to control the RGB
channels of each light. To
control these channels, I built
an easy to use DMX controller
using an Arduino and a DMX
shield. The controller provides
a rainbow fading effect and a
steady RGB using sliding
potentiometers. Once
completed, the LEDs and
controller operate identically
to the old fluorescent system.
